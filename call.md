We plan to have informal workshop proceedings. After the workshop, a selection of the contributions will be invited to a special issue in the journal [STTT](https://sttt.cs.uni-dortmund.de/). Workshop contributions can be extended abstracts or short papers, including already published results.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- ZX-Calculus
- Quantum Process Algebra
- Efficient Data Structures (e.g., Quantum Decision Diagrams and Tensor Networks)
- SAT/SMT Solving in Quantum Computing
- Programming Languages for Quantum Computing
- Quantum Topology
- Quantum Error Correction Codes (e.g., Topological Codes)
- Post-Quantum Cryptography
- ...
