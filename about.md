# About FMQC

The Workshop on Formal Methods in Quantum Computing (FMQC) will take place on August 25th, 2025 in Aarhus, Denmark. It will be co-located with CONFEST 2025.

The recent surge in quantum computing, driven by substantial investments from governments and industry leaders such as IBM and Google, highlights its growing significance in both research and applications. Positioned at the intersection of quantum physics, applied mathematics, and theoretical computer science, the field presents vast opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and synergy. This workshop, approaching quantum computing from a computer science perspective, seeks to bridge the gap between diverse research communities and foster the transfer of technology and methodologies from computer science, promoting cross-disciplinary innovation and progress.
